# TMA1

TMA1 gives you local-first observability for your AI agent.
Token usage, cost, latency — stored in a local GreptimeDB instance,
queryable with plain SQL. No cloud account. No Docker. No Grafana setup.
Works with Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, or any OTel-enabled agent.

The name comes from TMA-1 (Tycho Magnetic Anomaly-1) in *2001: A Space Odyssey*:
the monolith buried on the moon, silently recording everything until you dig it out.

---

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user wants to understand what their AI agent has been doing:

- "how much did my agent spend on tokens today?"
- "show me my agent's activity over the last week"
- "set up local observability for my agent"
- "I don't want to send telemetry to the cloud"
- "what tools is my agent calling?"
- "check for prompt injection attempts"

---

## When NOT to use this skill

- The user wants persistent memory across sessions → use mem9 instead
- The user already has TMA1 running and just wants to query data → use SQL directly

---

## What you get

TMA1 captures different data depending on the agent:

| Agent | Data path | What it captures |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Claude Code** | OTel metrics + logs | Token usage, cost, active time, tool decisions, API requests, user prompts |
| **OpenClaw** | OTel traces + metrics | LLM calls (model, tokens, cache), messages, webhooks, sessions, queue depth |
| **Other (GenAI SDK)** | OTel traces | Token usage, cost, latency, conversations (GenAI semantic conventions) |

The dashboard auto-detects the data source and shows the right view.

All data is stored locally in `~/.tma1/data/` and never leaves your machine.

Dashboard: **http://localhost:14318**

---

## Definition of Done

This task is NOT complete until all of the following are true:

1. TMA1 binary is installed and running (`tma1-server` process)
2. GreptimeDB is healthy at `http://localhost:14000/health`
3. The user's agent is configured to send OTel data to `http://localhost:14318/v1/otlp`
4. Agent has been restarted (if applicable)
5. Setup is verified (either `/status` returns ok, or the user confirms data is flowing)
6. The user has been sent the handoff message

---

## Onboarding

### Step 0 — Check for existing installation

`[AGENT]` Check if TMA1 is already running:

```bash
curl -sf http://localhost:14318/health && echo "RUNNING" || echo "NOT_RUNNING"
```

- If `RUNNING`: skip to Step 3 (configure agent).
- If `NOT_RUNNING`: continue to Step 1.

---

### Step 1 — Install TMA1

`[AGENT]` Download and run the TMA1 installer:

```bash
curl -sSL https://tma1.ai/install.sh | sh
```

This will:
1. Download the GreptimeDB binary into `~/.tma1/bin/`
2. Start `tma1-server` (which manages GreptimeDB and serves the dashboard)
3. Print the dashboard URL: `http://localhost:14318`

Wait ~15 seconds for GreptimeDB to start, then verify:

```bash
curl -sf http://localhost:14318/health && echo "OK" || echo "FAILED"
```

If it fails, tell the user:
> TMA1 didn't start correctly. Check `~/.tma1/tma1-server.log` for errors.

---

### Step 2 — Verify GreptimeDB is healthy

```bash
curl -sf http://localhost:14000/health && echo "GREPTIMEDB OK" || echo "GREPTIMEDB NOT READY"
```

If not healthy after 30 seconds, something is wrong with the install. Ask the user to check logs.

---

### Step 3 — Configure the agent

`[AGENT]` Configure the user's agent to send telemetry to TMA1. Choose the section that matches:

#### OpenClaw

```bash
openclaw config set diagnostics.enabled true
openclaw config set diagnostics.otel.enabled true
openclaw config set diagnostics.otel.endpoint http://localhost:14318/v1/otlp
openclaw config set diagnostics.otel.serviceName openclaw-gateway
openclaw config set diagnostics.otel.traces true
openclaw config set diagnostics.otel.metrics true
openclaw config set diagnostics.otel.logs true
openclaw gateway restart
```

#### Claude Code

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT": "http://localhost:14318/v1/otlp",
    "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL": "http/protobuf",
    "OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER": "otlp",
    "OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER": "otlp"
  }
}
```

Claude Code exports metrics and logs (not traces). The metrics/logs exporters must be explicitly enabled.

#### Any OTel SDK

```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:14318/v1/otlp
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf
# Then run your agent as usual
```

**Important:** After configuring, restart the agent so the new OTel config takes effect.

---

### Step 4 — Restart the agent

Restart the agent so the new OTel config takes effect.

---

### Step 5 — Verify data is flowing

Wait ~1 minute after restart, then check:

```bash
curl -sf http://localhost:14318/status | python3 -m json.tool
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "greptimedb": "running",
  "dashboard": "http://localhost:14318"
}
```

Also check if data has arrived:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:14318/api/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sql": "SHOW TABLES"}' \
  | python3 -m json.tool
```

If you see `opentelemetry_traces`, `openclaw_*`, or `claude_code_*` tables, data is flowing.

---

### Step 6 — Handoff

`[AGENT]` After successful setup, send this handoff to the user.
Translate into the user's language while keeping the structure.

```
✅ TMA1 is running.

📊 DASHBOARD
Open: http://localhost:14318
Your agent's token usage, cost, and latency are now being recorded locally.

🔍 EXAMPLE QUERIES
Open the GreptimeDB query console at http://localhost:14000/dashboard
and try these:

-- Today's cost by model (from flow aggregation)
SELECT model, ROUND(SUM(cost_usd), 4) AS total_cost
FROM tma1_cost_1m
WHERE time_window > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
GROUP BY model ORDER BY total_cost DESC;

-- Token usage by model today
SELECT model, SUM(input_tokens) AS input, SUM(output_tokens) AS output
FROM tma1_token_usage_1m
WHERE time_window > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
GROUP BY model ORDER BY input DESC;

💾 YOUR DATA
Stored locally in: ~/.tma1/data/
Never sent to any cloud service.

♻️ RESTART
If TMA1 stops, run: tma1-server
Or reinstall: curl -sSL https://tma1.ai/install.sh | sh
```

---

## Useful SQL queries (for agent use)

After TMA1 is set up, the agent can answer questions using these queries.

All queries go through:
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:14318/api/query \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"sql": "<SQL>"}'
```

**Important**: GreptimeDB uses `json_get_string()`, `json_get_int()`, `json_get_float()` for JSON column access. The `->` / `->>` operators are NOT supported.

### Detect available data

```sql
SHOW TABLES
```

Check which tables exist:
- `claude_code_cost_usage_USD_total` → Claude Code metrics
- `opentelemetry_traces` → traces from OpenClaw or GenAI SDK
- `openclaw_tokens_total` → OpenClaw metrics
- `tma1_cost_1m` → flow aggregations (from GenAI traces)

### OpenClaw Queries (traces + metrics)

**Recent LLM calls:**
```sql
SELECT timestamp,
       "span_attributes.openclaw.model" AS model,
       "span_attributes.openclaw.channel" AS channel,
       CAST("span_attributes.openclaw.tokens.input" AS BIGINT) AS input_tok,
       CAST("span_attributes.openclaw.tokens.output" AS BIGINT) AS output_tok,
       CAST("span_attributes.openclaw.tokens.cache_read" AS BIGINT) AS cache_read,
       ROUND(duration_nano / 1000000.0, 1) AS duration_ms
FROM opentelemetry_traces
WHERE span_name = 'openclaw.model.usage'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 20
```

**Token usage by model (from metrics):**
```sql
SELECT model, token_type, SUM(greptime_value) AS tokens
FROM openclaw_tokens_total
WHERE ts > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
GROUP BY model, token_type
ORDER BY tokens DESC
```

**Messages by channel:**
```sql
SELECT "span_attributes.openclaw.channel" AS channel,
       "span_attributes.openclaw.outcome" AS outcome,
       COUNT(*) AS messages
FROM opentelemetry_traces
WHERE span_name = 'openclaw.message.processed'
  AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
GROUP BY channel, outcome
ORDER BY messages DESC
```

**Error spans:**
```sql
SELECT timestamp, span_name,
       "span_attributes.openclaw.channel" AS channel,
       "span_attributes.openclaw.sessionKey" AS session
FROM opentelemetry_traces
WHERE span_name IN ('openclaw.webhook.error', 'openclaw.session.stuck')
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 20
```

### Claude Code Queries (metrics + logs)

**Cost summary (latest snapshot per model):**
```sql
SELECT model,
       ROUND(MAX(greptime_value), 4) AS cost_usd
FROM "claude_code_cost_usage_USD_total"
WHERE greptime_timestamp >= DATE_TRUNC('day', NOW())
GROUP BY model
ORDER BY cost_usd DESC
```

**Token usage (latest snapshot per model per type):**
```sql
SELECT model, type,
       MAX(greptime_value) AS tokens
FROM claude_code_token_usage_tokens_total
WHERE greptime_timestamp >= DATE_TRUNC('day', NOW())
GROUP BY model, type
ORDER BY model, type
```

**Recent API requests (from logs):**
```sql
SELECT timestamp,
       json_get_string(log_attributes, 'model') AS model,
       json_get_int(log_attributes, 'input_tokens') AS input_tok,
       json_get_int(log_attributes, 'output_tokens') AS output_tok,
       json_get_float(log_attributes, 'cost_usd') AS cost_usd,
       json_get_int(log_attributes, 'duration_ms') AS duration_ms
FROM opentelemetry_logs
WHERE body = 'claude_code.api_request'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 20
```

**Tool usage (from logs):**
```sql
SELECT json_get_string(log_attributes, 'tool_name') AS tool,
       COUNT(*) AS uses,
       ROUND(AVG(json_get_float(log_attributes, 'duration_ms'))) AS avg_ms
FROM opentelemetry_logs
WHERE body = 'claude_code.tool_result'
GROUP BY tool
ORDER BY uses DESC
```

### GenAI Traces Queries (other agents)

**Recent traces:**
```sql
SELECT span_name,
       "span_attributes.gen_ai.request.model" AS model,
       "span_attributes.gen_ai.usage.input_tokens" AS input_tok,
       "span_attributes.gen_ai.usage.output_tokens" AS output_tok,
       duration_nano / 1000000 AS duration_ms,
       timestamp
FROM opentelemetry_traces
WHERE "span_attributes.gen_ai.system" IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 20
```

**Cost from flow aggregation:**
```sql
SELECT model,
       ROUND(SUM(cost_usd), 4) AS cost_usd
FROM tma1_cost_1m
WHERE time_window >= DATE_TRUNC('day', NOW())
GROUP BY model
ORDER BY cost_usd DESC
```

**Token usage from flow aggregation:**
```sql
SELECT model,
       SUM(input_tokens) AS input_tok,
       SUM(output_tokens) AS output_tok,
       SUM(request_count) AS requests
FROM tma1_token_usage_1m
WHERE time_window >= DATE_TRUNC('day', NOW())
GROUP BY model
ORDER BY input_tok DESC
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `tma1-server` not starting | Check `~/.tma1/tma1-server.log`; verify port 14318 is free |
| GreptimeDB not healthy | Wait longer; check port 14000 is free |
| No data in dashboard | Verify agent OTel config points to `http://localhost:14318/v1/otlp` and restart the agent |
| Port conflict on 14000 | Set `TMA1_GREPTIMEDB_HTTP_PORT=14001` and update agent endpoint config |
| Dashboard shows "GREPTIMEDB: unreachable" | GreptimeDB crashed; restart with `tma1-server` |

---

## Coexistence with mem9

TMA1 and mem9 serve different purposes and work fine together:

| | mem9 | TMA1 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Purpose** | Persistent cross-session memory | Agent activity observability |
| **Data** | What the agent remembers | What the agent did |
| **Storage** | Cloud (or self-hosted) | Local only |
| **Query** | Memory search API | SQL |

Install both: mem9 for memory, TMA1 for observability.
